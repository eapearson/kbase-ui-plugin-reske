      This is JGI Search, a tool which allows you to search through public JGI archived data and import
      it into a KBase Narrative.
      
      To get started, simply type your search terms into the search box.

      You may simply enter all search terms by which you want to restrict the search by typing the words seaprated by at least one space -- all terms are "anded" together. The asterisk "*" may be appended to a term to match anything beginning with it. Searches are case insensitive.

      Note that this is a free-text search, so terms will match any available field. Searching by a genus, for instance, will match not just the genus field, but may match a title, description, scientific name, or file name.

      You may also use the following search operators:

        - **and**: include only items which include the follow term (this is the default when one search term follows another)
        - **or**: include all items which also may include the following term
        - **not**: reverses the meaning of the term -- "and not" means include only items which do not include the following term; "or not" means to include all items which do not include the following term;

      > Example: ```strep* and fastq``` will find all items with a word beginning with "strep" and including the exact word "fastq". To restrict the search to a more specific genus you could instead use "streptococcus and fastq"
